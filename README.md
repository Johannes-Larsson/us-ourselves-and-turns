# us-ourselves-and-turns
A game inspired by [Us, ourselves, and us: the duel](https://indietom.itch.io/us-ourselves-and-us-the-duel), 
a game that @indietom and I made for No More Sweden 2017.  
That was a twin-stick shooter were your gost(s) respawned after each round, repeating your actions.  

This game builds on the same concept, but is turn based, 
giving you control over ghosts that might have died in earlier rounds but not this one.

Currently made using processing.
